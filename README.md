Each exercise is provided as a separate SQL script file in the directory.
You can work on these exercises in any SQL environment that you prefer, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or Oracle.

The exercises cover a range of topics, including:

->Basic SELECT statements
->Joins and subqueries
->Aggregation and grouping
->String manipulation and regular expressions
->Date and time functions
->Window functions and ranking
->To get started, simply choose an exercise file that matches your skill level and interests, and try to solve the problems posed in the comments.
You can also refer to the "solutions" directory to check your answers and learn new approaches.

The Directory contains sample data sets that you can use to practice your SQL queries. These data sets include fictional data about customers, orders, products, and employees, as well as real-world data about countries, cities, and populations.
